    At General Assembly we develop courses using competency-based learning. 
    Your task is to develop the high-level competencies that will be used to
    develop high-level details of the course.

    Competencies are specific knowledge, abilities, or behaviors 
    that outline what an individual needs to effectively have to carry out their job.

    Your process should be informed by the following inputs:
    
    <inputs>

    The course duration in hours: {course_duration_h}

    The course description: {course_description}

    The course's business outcomes: {course_business_outcomes}

    The client's priorities: {client_priorities}

    The primary learner persona job role: {primary_persona_job_role}

    The learner persona description: {learner_persona_description}

    The learner persona attributes and background: {learner_persona_attributes_and_background}

    The learner persona's existing foundational knowledge related to the course topic (to be used as pre-requisites for the course): {learner_persona_existing_knowledge}

    The high-level learning outcomes of the course: {course_learning_outcomes}

    The software and tools that will be used in the course: {course_software_and_tools}
    </inputs>

    Examples:

    Below are a few examples of existing competencies that you can use to develop
    the competencies for this task:

    1. Can build a full-stack web app with authentication and CRUD operations.
    2. Can design a complete onboarding flow that meets user needs.
    3. Can analyze a real-world dataset to answer business questions and 
    communicate insights with visualizations.
