{"id":"27","title":"Heuristic Evaluation Lab","overview":"In this hands-on lab, participants will evaluate a sample interface in Miro against established product requirements, user needs, and technical constraints. By systematically applying Nielsen’s heuristics, participants will identify and document usability issues on a shared Miro board. The sample interface uses the Currency Design System to give you practice with collaborative design systems and consistent UI patterns. You will categorize each issue, rank its severity and impact, and propose actionable design improvements aligned with system guidelines. This lab prepares you to conduct rigorous heuristic evaluations and deliver prioritized recommendations in real-world projects.","time_estimate_m":60,"type":"lab","rationale":"Offers hands-on practice applying evaluation methods to real designs.","tools_and_technologies":["Miro"],"qa_feedback":["Overview is only one sentence and needs to be expanded to 4–5 sentences using student-facing language to clearly describe the activity.","Overview should explicitly call out that participants will evaluate the interface against product requirements, user needs, and technical constraints to align with the stated competency.","Consider clarifying if the sample interface uses the Currency Design System to meet the client priority of exposure and practice with collaborative design systems."],"learning_objectives":["Apply Nielsen’s heuristics to the sample interface in Miro and identify at least five usability violations.","Categorize each documented usability issue as a violation of product requirements, user needs, or technical constraints.","Prioritize identified heuristic violations by ranking them according to severity and impact on key user tasks.","Propose two actionable design improvements for each high-severity violation that adhere to the Currency Design System guidelines.","Document your evaluation findings and improvement suggestions on a structured Miro board with the provided template."]}
