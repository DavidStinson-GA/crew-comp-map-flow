    "title": "Design Rationale Frameworks",
    "overview": "This lecture covers popular frameworks for documenting and presenting design decisions, such as CIRCLES and 5 Whys. You’ll learn how to structure your rationale around user needs, constraints, and trade-offs. By the end, you’ll have a template for clear, persuasive design arguments.",
