    {
      "competency": "Develop and refine wireframes to communicate design solutions",
      "time_estimate_m": 300,
      "rationale": "Wireframing aligns with the need for engineers to visually communicate and collaboratively iterate on ideas, satisfying the client's priority for tool-based communication (such as Miro) and supporting efficient collaborative processes to speed up development and design alignment. Practice and feedback cycles are embedded in this duration."
    },
    {
      "competency": "Apply information architecture principles to structure product interfaces",
      "time_estimate_m": 210,
      "rationale": "Information architecture is foundational to effective navigation and product usability, supporting learning outcomes related to structuring logical navigation and enhancing foundational visual design. This competency complements learners' existing skills in UI building and expands their critical design decision-making."
    },
    {
      "competency": "Build high-fidelity, interactive prototypes demonstrating end-to-end design flows",
      "time_estimate_m": 330,
      "rationale": "This addresses the business outcome of creating polished, professional designs and supports the client's focus on exposure to design systems (such as Primer Design System). The allotted time includes instruction, guided practice, tool setup, and peer review sessions."
    },
    {
      "competency": "Evaluate designs against business goals and technical constraints",
      "time_estimate_m": 240,
      "rationale": "Meeting business requirements and technical constraints ensures designs are realistic and valuable, aligning with both business outcomes and learning outcomes, including the use of product management techniques. The duration allows for in-depth application to real-world scenarios and robust group critique."
    },
    {
      "competency": "Utilize a design system when implementing UI components",
      "time_estimate_m": 180,
      "rationale": "This competency targets the client's priority of reinforcing cohesive product design and increasing efficiency by leveraging reusable UI components. It also supports the business goal of making developers more self-reliant in design implementation. This estimate incorporates setup, guided walkthrough, and exercise."
