  "title": "Feedback Collection Methods",
  "overview": "In this lecture, you'll explore three core methods for gathering user feedback: moderated usability testing, surveys, and in-app analytics. You'll learn how to select the appropriate technique based on research goals and project constraints. We'll discuss best practices for designing tests, writing survey questions, and setting up analytics tracking. Through real-world examples and hands-on walkthroughs in Miro, you’ll see how feedback drives rapid iteration and improves design outcomes. By the end of this session, you’ll be equipped to plan and schedule feedback activities that integrate seamlessly into your design workflow.",
