{"id":"24","title":"Prototyping Iteration Lab","overview":"In this lab, you’ll build and refine a functional prototype based on user feedback. You’ll cycle through testing, gather insights, and implement changes. By the end, you’ll have a validated solution ready for handoff.","time_estimate_m":150,"type":"lab","rationale":"Offers hands-on experience iterating prototypes, reinforcing iterative development and user-centered design.","tools_and_technologies":["Visual Studio Code"],"qa_feedback":[  
  "Expand the module overview to 4–5 sentences, explicitly framing how learners will draw on prior baseline research outputs and articulate their iteration goals.",  
  "Introduce a collaborative low-fidelity prototyping step using Miro before moving into high-fidelity code-based prototypes in VS Code.",  
  "Reference the Currency Design System to guide consistent UI component usage and teach efficient design handoff practices.",  
  "Incorporate a checkpoint for learners to map user research insights to specific prototype changes, reinforcing research-driven decision-making.",  
  "Clarify how this lab advances course business outcomes such as speeding up design and development collaboration by highlighting streamlined iteration workflows."
