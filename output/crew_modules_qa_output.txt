      "overview": "We’ll cover core principles of color theory, typography, spacing, and layout. You’ll see how these elements impact readability and aesthetics. By the end, you’ll have a toolkit for applying visual hierarchy and consistent styling to your work. We will examine how these principles are applied in real-world design systems to maintain consistency across products.",

      "title": "Visual Refinement Lab",
      "overview": "In VS Code, you’ll apply visual design principles to a sample HTML/CSS interface. You’ll adjust color schemes, refine typography, and polish spacing. Before coding, you’ll sketch initial refinements using a design system reference. This hands-on exercise cements your ability to enhance both usability and aesthetics, simulating real-world collaboration between engineers and designers.",
